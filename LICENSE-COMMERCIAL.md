# CodeWalk Commercial License

## 1. Overview

CodeWalk is dual-licensed:

- **Open Source (default):** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Commercial (this document):** A separate commercial license for qualifying organizations, described below.

The commercial license is required **only** for organizations whose Annual Revenue exceeds the Revenue Threshold (defined below) and that wish to use the Software without complying with AGPLv3 obligations (such as source code disclosure).

## 2. Definitions

- **"Software"** means CodeWalk and all associated source code, documentation, and assets distributed in this repository.
- **"Organization"** means the legal entity (corporation, LLC, partnership, or equivalent) using the Software.

2. The Organization wishes to use, deploy, or distribute the Software (or derivative works) without complying with the AGPLv3 obligations — including but not limited to the requirement to disclose source code of modified versions.

Organizations below the Revenue Threshold, or those willing to comply with AGPLv3, do not need this license and may use the Software freely under the AGPLv3.

- Payment terms, duration, and renewal conditions will be specified in the executed license agreement.

## 7. Termination

- **Breach:** If the Organization breaches any term of the commercial license agreement, the copyright holder may terminate the license upon written notice. The Organization must then cease all use and destroy all copies of the Software.
- **Voluntary:** The Organization may terminate at any time by ceasing use and destroying all copies.
- **Survival:** Sections 8 (Warranty Disclaimer) and 9 (Limitation of Liability) survive termination.
